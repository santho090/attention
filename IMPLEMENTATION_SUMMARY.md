# Transformer Implementation: "Attention Is All You Need"

## Overview

This repository contains a complete PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the seminal paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. (2017). The implementation is faithful to the original paper and includes all key components and training infrastructure.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All components have been successfully implemented and tested:

### Core Architecture Components
- ✅ **Multi-Head Attention**: Scaled dot-product attention with 8 heads
- ✅ **Positional Encoding**: Sine/cosine positional embeddings
- ✅ **Encoder Stack**: 6 identical encoder layers with residual connections
- ✅ **Decoder Stack**: 6 identical decoder layers with masked self-attention
- ✅ **Feed-Forward Networks**: Position-wise FFN with ReLU activation
- ✅ **Layer Normalization**: Applied after each sub-layer
- ✅ **Residual Connections**: Around each sub-layer

### Training Infrastructure
- ✅ **Label Smoothing Loss**: Regularization technique from the paper
- ✅ **Noam Learning Rate Scheduler**: Warmup + decay as specified
- ✅ **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents gradient explosion
- ✅ **Masking**: Proper padding and causal masking
- ✅ **Data Loading**: Flexible dataset and dataloader implementation
- ✅ **Inference**: Greedy decoding for sequence generation
