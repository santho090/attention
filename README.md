# Transformer: "Attention Is All You Need" Implementation

This repository contains a complete PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the seminal paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. (2017).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Transformer model consists of the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Head Attention**: The heart of the Transformer, allowing the model to attend to different positions simultaneously
2. **Positional Encoding**: Sine and cosine functions to inject position information into the model
3. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks**: Two linear transformations with ReLU activation
4. **Layer Normalization**: Applied after each sub-layer with residual connections
5. **Encoder Stack**: 6 identical layers, each with self-attention and feed-forward components
6. **Decoder Stack**: 6 identical layers with masked self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward components

### Key Features from the Paper

- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k)V
- **Multi-Head Attention**: 8 parallel attention heads
- **Positional Encoding**: PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
- **Label Smoothing**: Regularization technique for training
- **Noam Learning Rate Schedule**: Warmup followed by decay
- **Residual Connections**: Around each sub-layer
- **Dropout**: Applied throughout the network

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from transformer import create_transformer_model
import torch

# Create model with paper's default hyperparameters
model = create_transformer_model(
    src_vocab_size=10000,
    tgt_vocab_size=10000,
    d_model=512,
    n_heads=8,
    n_layers=6,
    d_ff=2048
)

# Example forward pass
batch_size, src_len, tgt_len = 2, 10, 8
src = torch.randint(1, 10000, (batch_size, src_len))
tgt = torch.randint(1, 10000, (batch_size, tgt_len))

output = model(src, tgt)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")  # [batch_size, tgt_len, tgt_vocab_size]
```

### Training

```bash
python train_transformer.py
```

The training script includes:
- Dummy data generation for demonstration
- Label smoothing loss
- Noam learning rate scheduler
- Gradient clipping
- Model checkpointing
- Validation loop

## üîß Model Architecture Details

### Hyperparameters (from paper)

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| d_model | 512 | Model dimension |
| n_heads | 8 | Number of attention heads |
| n_layers | 6 | Number of encoder/decoder layers |
| d_ff | 2048 | Feed-forward dimension |
| dropout | 0.1 | Dropout rate |
| warmup_steps | 4000 | Learning rate warmup steps |

### Attention Mechanism

The multi-head attention mechanism computes:

```
MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
where head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

### Positional Encoding

Position information is added using sine and cosine functions:

```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```
